                <h2>Design & Development</h2>
                <p>I didn’t have access to the internet growing up. The first time I saw a computer was in 2003,
                   and I was amazed by what it could do. The speed and depth of information it provided were incredible,
                    but education was both limited and expensive. I worked various jobs over the years until I eventually
                     settled in Canada. Driven by my passion, I started learning computer programming languages and quickly
                     picked up new skills. Today, I’m proud to say that I am a Full Stack Developer.</p>
